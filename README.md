### SARS

The **focus** herein is the modelling or forecasting of SARS-CoV-2 related trends, and risks, via Bayesian 
modelling.  Both PyMC3 and TensorFlow Probability (TFP) are being explored.  The advantage of the latter is performance.

#### An Example

<img src="notebooks/inpatients/capita/capita.png" style="width:75%; float:middle;"/>

**This diagram** illustrates the preliminary results of a forecasting investigation.  A stochastic model wherein the 
observed measures, i.e.,  the accumulative series of

* positive cases per 100K 

* hospitalised patients per 100K

* deaths per 100K

are set as **co-varying dependent variables**.  The term **per 100K** means **per 100K of the population of an area in question**.  The independent 
variable is days thus far.  The model predicts 21 days ahead, therefore the observations curves are shorter than the 
estimates curves; more details are continuously outlined in 
the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/plausibilities/sars/blob/develop/notebooks/inpatients/capita.ipynb" target="_blank">capita.ipynb notebook</a>, 
and its supplementary programs.  Aleatoric/epistemic uncertainties 
are considered.  [Read more about uncertainities in (a) [A New Approach to Risk: The Implications of E3](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27670018?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=Aleatory+or+epistemic+Does+it+matter&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3DAleatory%2Bor%2Bepistemic%2BDoes%2Bit%2Bmatter%26pagemark%3DeyJwYWdlIjoyLCJzdGFydHMiOnsiSlNUT1JCYXNpYyI6MjV9fQ%253D%253D%26cty_journal_facet%3Dam91cm5hbA%253D%253D%26disc_business_discipline_facet%3DYnVzaW5lc3MtZGlzY2lwbGluZQ%253D%253D%26disc_statistics_discipline_facet%3Dc3RhdGlzdGljcy1kaXNjaXBsaW5l&ab_segments=0%2Fbasic_SYC-5187_SYC-5188%2F5187&refreqid=fastly-default%3Abd055fbf2081671cec304ca7ca932670&seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents), and (b) 
[Aleatory or epistemic? Does it matter?](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167473008000556?via%3Dihub)]

In a deployed mode, we'd

* run the model daily.

* replace the x-axis values **days thus far** with **dates**.

* continuously compare model predictions with real values; therefore require curves of predictions & percentage errors, at least.

* use interactive graphs, e.g., Tableau, HighCharts, D3, etc.

#### Notebooks & Programs

[Notebooks](./notebooks):

The notebooks are intentionally light.  The approach ... light notebooks, and supplementary programs written in-line 
with the best practices of a development team, therefore minimising or eliminating the *prototyping â†’ deployment* 
transition effort.  A helpful tool for this is the 
excellent [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).  GitHub Actions simplifies software workflow 
automation and continuous integration & delivery.

The programs of this project, all located within directory [sars](./sars), are subject to the inspection 
settings outlined in the GitHub Actions file [main.yml](.github/workflows/main.yml).  Hence, each time a program 
is committed GitHub Actions performs inspections w.r.t. 
the [settings](https://github.com/plausibilities/sars/runs/1545478635) of main.yml.
