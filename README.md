### SARS

The **focus** herein is the modelling or forecasting of SARS-CoV-2 related trends, and risks, via Bayesian 
modelling.  Both PyMC3 and TensorFlow Probability (TFP) are being explored.  The advantage of the latter is performance.

<br>

#### An Example

<img src="notebooks/inpatients/capita/capita.png" style="width:75%; float:middle;"/>

**This diagram** illustrates the preliminary results of a forecasting investigation.  A stochastic model wherein the 
observed measures, i.e.,  the accumulative series of

* positive cases per 100K 

* hospitalised patients per 100K

* deaths per 100K

are set as **co-varying dependent variables**.  The term **per 100K** means **per 100K of the population of an area in question**.  The independent 
variable is days thus far.  The model predicts 21 days ahead, therefore the observations curves are shorter than the 
estimates curves; more details are continuously outlined in 
the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/plausibilities/sars/blob/develop/notebooks/inpatients/capita.ipynb" target="_blank">capita.ipynb notebook</a>, 
and its supplementary programs.

In a deployed mode, we'd aim to

* run the model daily.

* replace the x-axis values **days thus far** with **dates**.

* continuously compare model predictions with real values; therefore require curves of predictions & percentage errors, at least.

* use an interactive graphs, e.g., Tableau, HighCharts, D3, etc.

#### Notebooks & Programs

[Notebooks](./notebooks):

The notebooks are intentionally light.  The approach ... light notebooks, and supplementary programs written in-line 
with the best practices of a development team, therefore minimising or eliminating the *prototyping â†’ deployment* 
transition effort.  A helpful tool for this is the 
excellent [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).  GitHub Actions simplifies software workflow 
automation and continuous integration & delivery.

The programs of this project, all located within directory [sars](./sars), are subject to the inspection 
settings outlined in the GitHub Actions file [main.yml](.github/workflows/main.yml).  Hence, each time a program 
is committed GitHub Actions performs inspections w.r.t. 
the [settings](https://github.com/plausibilities/sars/runs/1545478635) of main.yml.
